I can't think strait, girl you're always on my mind
It's keeping me up late, can't even get to work on time
Got a fever burning up inside
I see your face each time i close my eyes

You're my hearts desire, always thinkin' of you
Hearts desire, girl i want you so bad
Like a car spinnin' out of control with a blown out tire

You're my hearts desire, do beleive i love you
Hearts desire, best i never had
Got a yearnin' down deep, and i don't want to put out the fire
Cause you're my hearts desire

You walk by, i can barly speak your name
You bat your eyes and my courage goes down the drain
My chest is poundin' and i must confess
Girl you're givin' me a cardiac arrest

Like a sweet tooth cravin' candy
Got such a longin' i can hardly stand it

You're my hearts desire, do beleive i love you
Hearts desire, best i never had
Got a yearnin' down deep, and i don't want to put out the fire
Cause you're my hearts desire
